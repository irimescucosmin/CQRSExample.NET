### CQRSExample.NET

The repository contains the source code for a CQRS implementation using MediatR. This code was written to accompany the tutorial [CQRS Pattern with MediatR in ASP.NET Core](https://cosminirimescu.com/modello-cqrs-con-mediatr-in-asp-net-core/) (Italian language).

The service is implemented using ASP.NET Core and offers the following functionality:

- Reading a list of users
- Adding new users to a temporary database

The Swagger interface has been integrated to simplify API testing directly from the browser, allowing you to send requests and verify results in an intuitive manner.

This repository provides a starting point for the development of a CQRS-based service using ASP.NET Core.
